# First-Aid of Programming
1. **Google:**
  Before asking a question from anyone, remember you should always google it.
2. **StackExchange:**
  If you are sure that your question needs special time to fix the error. Consider asking the question on *[StackExchange sites]*.
3. **Ask in chat rooms:**
  If your question needs more informal attention or requires opinion, do not ask on *[StackExchange sites]*, instead, prefer chat rooms.
    - [*ALiAS Whatsapp Group*](http://asetalias.in)
    - [*ALiAS Telegram Group*](https://t.me/asetalias)
    - [*The Devs Groups*](http://thedevs.network)

    - [ILUG-D Telegram Group](http://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEAc48wCHkUXViXBcg)    
4. **Doubt on Mailing list**:
 If push comes to shove, open a thread in the [mailing-list] but remember about the [guidelines].

When asking doubts in chat rooms, remember no one is being paid to solve your problem, they’ll answer or they’ll ignore, it depends on your language of your question, it’s your responsibility to keep your question easy to understand for the reader.

- Ask specific question. Broad questions never receive good response.
- Show your research.
- Trim the code to the least required part for debugging
- Use services like [hastebin](http://hastebin.com) for sending code snippets. Laptop photos from phone are ignored by a lot of people (Use screen capture).
- It is not preferred to Direct message to the group admin(s). **Ask in the Group!**

**REMEMBER:**   No one will solve your program and compile the result for you. At best, you can expect help you reach the answer.

# Where should I get started ?

It is always recommended that you should try out other technologies before settling on one. Start with whatever interests you, do not expect someone to choose a field for you.

>  **“Flirt with all technologies, Marry one.”**
>  **—  Anuvrat Parashar**

Once you have decided upon the technology you plan to work with, refer these learning resources[1]. If you find some other useful resources, feel free to add them to the list.

# Projects

Education without purpose is pointless.
Projects give your learning a purpose. So start a new project or refer[2] for active projects. You are free to add your project to this list.
******REMEMBER:**  Projects here are fulfill the purpose of learning, you are **not** expected to know Python to take a project on Python, Rather, you are expected to learn Python while working on the project.

# Mailing List
ALiAS is an opensource community, hence all the information for decision making is available on the [mailing-list]. It is recommended for members to subscribe to the mailing list. There are some [guidelines] you are expected to follow when posting on the mailing list.

**REMEMBER:** Don’t be shy to ask questions. No question is stupid, everyone needs time to adjust to the new culture. So feel free to ask any questions that you might have.

# Must Know
****## **1. Git**

If you plan to work on projects with people, it is of paramount importance to know how to use Git.

## **2. Mailing List Guild-lines**

When you work on open-source projects and need to communicate with the developers, the recommended way to do that in most communities is using mailing lists. Before posting on mailing list you should know about the guild-lines[8] of posting on a mailing list.

## **3. Reading & Writing code**

Writing code is an essential part of becoming a programmer, equally important is reading other developer’s codes.

> **“A person who won’t read is no better than a person who can’t read.”**
> **—** **Mark Twain**

If you understand a concept, it is always encouraged to explain it to the computer, i.e write the code to implement the concept.

## **4. Voting System**

To show agreement/disagreement to the topic, we use +1,+0,-0,-1

    +1: “I love the idea and I'm strongly committed to it.”
    +0: “Sounds OK to me.”
    -0: “I’m not thrilled, but I won’t stand in the way.”
    -1: “I strongly disagree and would be very unhappy to see the idea turn into reality.”


## **5. What is OD?**

If an event says "ODs Provided" that means you'll be marked present for the classes which you miss because of the event. It takes about 1-2 days for the present to be reflected on amizone and foreign language classes take even more time.

## **6. Developer Communities**

We promote members to take parts in the communities.

> **"You are the average of the group with which you spend your time."**
>  **—  Anuvrat Parashar**

With that thought in mind, developer communities can be found at meetup.com;
ILUG-D[6] & PyDelhi[5] are recommended communities, feel free to explore more and inform all the members about them.

## **7. No Sir/Ma’am**

We encourage members to call with their peers/seniors with first name and not use titles like “sir” or “ma’am” in any conversation.

## **8. Volunteer**

ALiAS is volunteer driven open-source community, and it’s your responsibility to update/improve the resources that you come across or make new resources to help other people of the community. You are also requested to help other members of the community if they face a problem. That includes code related queries and otherwise (say a relatively new in the community has some query about participation).

# Know Something? Teach Others.

An essential part of becoming a programmer is know-how to “sell” your code, in other words, explaining the code/skill to other developers is quite crucial.
ALiAS gives you a opportunity to showcase what you have already learnt and teach it to others. At ALiAS, talks and hands-on workshops take place monthly where people from within the community come out on to the podium to show what they have learnt in the past and eventually help others in learning as well. To take a talk on a subject, you need to propose it on the mailing list in the correct format[11].

If you are **not** a member of ALiAS community and you wish to join. Please go to our website[9] and click on **Join Now.**

**NOTE:**  While ALiAS is only open for Amity Students, communities like **PyDelhi**, **ILUG-D** welcome anyone without such restrictions.

**Catch you in meetup.** Toodles!
